# LEARNING BASH SCRIPTING

## WHAT IS BASH?
Bash is a vital tool for managing Linux Machines. The name is short of "Bourne Again Shell"

A Shell is a program that commands the operating system to perform actions.
You can enter commands in a console of your computer and run the commands directly, or you can use scripts to run batches of commands.

There are another linux Shell, like `csh` and `zsh`, but `Bash` has become de facto Linux Standar.
